# BLACKSKY-MD Premium Heroku Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes and improvements implemented to ensure stable 24/7 operation of BLACKSKY-MD Premium on Heroku.

## üõ†Ô∏è Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Port Conflict Resolution (EADDRINUSE Error)
- **Problem**: Multiple server instances trying to use the same port (port 41615), causing "EADDRINUSE" errors
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic port allocation and conflict detection
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `heroku-connection-keeper.js`
  - `connection-patch.js`

### 2. PostgreSQL Connection Handling
- **Problem**: Bot crashes when DATABASE_URL not available or when connection fails
- **Solution**: Added robust error handling with fallback mechanisms
- **Benefits**: Bot now works even without database connection (with reduced persistence features)

### 3. Session Persistence Improvement
- **Problem**: Sessions lost during dyno cycling or restarts
- **Solution**: Enhanced database backup/restore with fallback to file-based storage
- **Files Modified**: `heroku-bot-starter.js`

## üìã Best Practices for Deployment

### 1. Plan Recommendation
- We strongly recommend using at least the "Eco" plan ($5/month) for 24/7 operation
- Free dynos sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity, making them unsuitable for WhatsApp bots

### 2. Required Environment Variables
- **HEROKU_APP_URL**: Your app's URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com)
- **SESSION_ID**: Any unique name for your WhatsApp session
- **OWNER_NUMBER**: Your WhatsApp number with country code (e.g., 491556315347)

### 3. PostgreSQL Database
- Essential for persisting sessions across dyno restarts
- Already configured in app.json for one-click deployments
- Can be added manually: `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:mini -a your-app-name`

## üìö Documentation Updates

We've enhanced the deployment documentation to include:
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Recommended configurations for optimal performance
- Maintenance and monitoring guidelines

See the updated `HEROKU-DEPLOYMENT-UPDATED.md` for comprehensive deployment instructions.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

1. Deploy using the updated instructions in `HEROKU-DEPLOYMENT-UPDATED.md`
2. Ensure you set all recommended environment variables
3. Monitor logs for any issues after deployment
4. Use PostgreSQL for session persistence across dyno restarts

**Note**: These changes ensure the BLACKSKY-MD Premium bot can operate reliably 24/7 on Heroku, with automatic recovery from common issues like connection drops, port conflicts, and database connection problems.
